**Stocks-Data-Extraction-and-Visualization**

In this project, I will extract stock data using a Python library. I will be using the yfinance library, it allows us to extract data for stocks returning data in a pandas dataframe.
In some cases, the data may not be available through the library. Hence, I have also used web scraping technique to get the data to analyze.
I have used Apple, Netflix and Tesla stock data for this project.
